Recommended tools: VirtualBox, VMware, or any preferred virtualization software.

Part 2: Emulating an Adversary - Making & Observing Noise

Perform basic attack techniques to generate logs and alerts.

Utilize common adversary tactics to observe system behaviors.

Part 3: Crafting Detections for Adversary Behavior

Analyze the generated logs and create custom detection rules.

Utilize detection methodologies applicable across various security platforms.

Part 4: Blocking an Attack

Implement real-time defenses based on crafted detection rules.

Test the effectiveness of different security measures.

Part 5: Tuning False Positives

Adjust detection rules to minimize false positives.

Enhance detection accuracy by refining rules and alert criteria.

Part 6: Triggering YARA Scans with Detection Rules
